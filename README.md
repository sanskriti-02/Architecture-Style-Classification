# Efficient Architecture Style Classification and Synthesis Using FastAI and ResNet50

Architecture classification poses significant challenges due to ambiguous boundaries between styles, particularly when dealing with datasets containing numerous labels. The lack of clear demarcations complicates the task, especially when considering styles predominantly present in European civilizations. This study integrates FastAI and ResNet50 architectures to address these complexities efficiently. Leveraging the architectural styles dataset from Kaggle with 25 European architecture styles, the research emphasizes minimizing information loss during convolution and pooling processes. FastAI's image transformation and noise reduction tools enhance data quality, optimizing memory and time constraints.

The study focuses on two domains: architecture style classification and synthesis of combined architectural styles. ResNet50 trained with FastAI demonstrates superior performance in classification tasks, reducing processing time without compromising accuracy. Class imbalance issues are mitigated using image augmentation techniques, with a classification interpreter identifying confused architecture styles and optimizing neural networks to prevent overfitting.

Moreover, the study explores architectural style synthesis using Pix2Pix cGANs. By blending characteristics of Art Nouveau and Queen Anne architectures, the approach generates visually appealing images merging distinct features from both styles. The integrated ResNet50 and FastAI methodology significantly reduces processing time, enhances classification accuracy, and advances architectural image processing methodologies.
